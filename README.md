# Face_Generation

Generative adversarial networks used for face generation. CelebA dataset used.

Examples include:
*DCGAN
*ProGAN

ProGAN is generating results that are superior to the standard DCGAN. For instance, comparing the results at just 64x64 you can see the ProGAN has much better facial structure and fine details; generally sharper images.

Be careful of mode collapse.
